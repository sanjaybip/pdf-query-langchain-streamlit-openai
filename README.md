# Query the uploaded PDF file using LangChain and OpenAI (LLM)

This is basic LLM app that let you ask any question from your uploaded PDF file. We have used LangChain and OpenAI to create this app. Also, we are using streamlit to createa very minimal GUI so that you can upload your PDF file and query it.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the streamlit GUI, run the following command

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
